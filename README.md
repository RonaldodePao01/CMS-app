# React CMS App

## Description

This is a React app I created following this [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/). The app is a simple webpage that makes use of headless CMS to store and retrieve data and uses a custom hook (useFetchProjects) to fetch the data from the CMS as well as to handle state for the application.

#### Install and Setup

- npm install
- npm run dev

### Deployment

This app has been deployed using Netlify and can be found at this [link](https://cms-app-ron.netlify.app/)

#### Headless CMS

A headless CMS is a back-end only content management system that provides content creators with an intuitive interface for creating and managing content, while leaving the front-end presentation layer to be handled by a separate system or platform. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as the content can be easily distributed to multiple channels and devices, without being limited by the constraints of a particular front-end system.
